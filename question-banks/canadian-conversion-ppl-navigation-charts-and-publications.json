              "explanation": "Shoshone County Airport is below 3, just west of the 116° line of longitude. There are 60 min. between the 116° line and the 117° line, depicted in 1-min. tick marks. Shoshone is 11 tick marks (11 min.) past the 116° line. Find the labeled 48° latitude line just northeast of the 116° line. The latitude and longitude lines are presented each 30 min. Since lines of latitude are also divided into 1 min. tick marks, the airport is three tick marks above the 47°30' line or 47°33'N. The correct latitude and longitude is thus 47°33'N – 116°11'W.

              "correctAnswer": 0,
              "explanation": "First locate the Cooperstown Airport on Fig. 26. It is just above 2, middle right of chart. Note that it is to the left (west) of the 98° line of longitude. The line of longitude on the left side of the chart is 99°. Thus, the longitude is a little bit more than 98°W, but not near 99°W. With respect to latitude, note that Cooperstown Airport is just below a line of latitude that is not marked in terms of degrees. However, the next line of latitude below is 47° (see the left side of the chart, northwest of Jamestown Airport). As with longitude, there are two lines of latitude for every degree of latitude; i.e., each line is 30 min. Thus, latitude of the Cooperstown Airport is almost 47°30'N, but not quite. Accordingly, Cooperstown Airport's latitude is 47°25'N and longitude is 98°06'W. (FAA-H-8083-25C Chap 16)",

The longitude line to the west of 101° is 101° 30 minutes (each additional crossline is 1 minute). Find 101° 36 minutes by moving west six additional crosslines. The latitude line south of 48° is 47° 30 minutes (each additional crossline is 1 minute). Find 47° 41 minutes by moving north an additional 11 crosslines.

Accordingly, the airport you are seeking is 17 min. to the east of that line. Each crossline is 1 min. on the latitude and longitude lines. The 48°N latitude line is approximately two-thirds of the way up the chart. The 47°30'N latitude line is about one-fourth of the way up. One-third up from 47°30'N to 48°N latitude would be 47°34'N. At this spot is Makeeff Airport. (FAA-H-8083-25C Chap 16)",

Next find the 101° line of longitude and go left one tick mark and draw a vertical line. The closest airport is Washburn. (FAA-H-8083-25C Chap 16)",

              "explanation": "On Fig. 20, find the Currituck County Airport, which is northeast of Area 3. Note that the airport symbol is just to the west of 76° longitude (find 76° just north of Virginia Beach). There are 60 min. between the 76°W and 77°W lines of longitude, with each tick mark depicting 1 min. The airport is one tick mark to the west of the 76° line, or 76°01'W. The latitude is below the 30-min. latitude line across the center of the chart. See the numbered latitude lines at the top (37°) of the chart. Since each tick mark represents 1 min. of latitude, and the airport is approximately six tick marks south of the 36°30'N latitude, the airport is at 36°24'N latitude. Thus, Currituck County Airport is at approximately 36°24'N – 76°01'W. (FAA-H-8083-25C Chap 16)",
