              "question": "What is the approximate base of the cumulus clouds if the surface air temperature at 1,000 feet MSL is 70°F and the dewpoint is 48°F?",
              "type": "multiple-choice",
              "answers": [
                "4,000 feet MSL.",

              ],
              "correctAnswer": 1,
              "explanation": "To find the base of cumulus clouds, use the formula: Cloud base = surface temperature - dewpoint temperature, divided by 4.4°F per 1,000 feet. (70 - 48) ÷ 4.4 = 5 thousand feet. Adding the 1,000 feet MSL surface elevation gives 6,000 feet MSL."

                "Poor visibility, steady precipitation, and stratus-type clouds.",

              "correctAnswer": 2,
              "explanation": "Low-pressure systems are associated with poor visibility, intermittent precipitation, and cumulus-type clouds due to the unstable air mass and upward vertical motion."

                "The first flickering of the CDI as it centers.",

              "correctAnswer": 2,

              "correctAnswer": 2,
              "explanation": "Distance = Speed × Time. Convert 2.5 minutes to hours: 2.5 ÷ 60 = 0.0417 hours. Distance = 98 knots × 0.0417 hours = 4.08 nautical miles."
