      "explanation": "A Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate is another form of registration. It is valid only for flights within the United States by the manufacturer or a dealer for flight testing or demonstration for sale and must be removed by the dealer when the aircraft is sold. The back side of the registration is filled out with the appropriate information from the sale as well as the new owner's name. The certificate must then be mailed back to the FAA registry in Oklahoma City. Doing so protects the buyer and seller.
